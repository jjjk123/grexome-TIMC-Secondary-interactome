I want the canonical transcripts in BED format (for samtools bedconv),
producing this:
gunzip -c canonicalTranscripts_190918.tsv.gz | canonicalTranscripts_table2bed.pl | gzip -c > canonicalTranscripts_190918.bed.gz

AOK.

Need to work from the GTF since direct ensembl access is too slow.
Grabbing the latest ensembl Human GTF in /data/Ensembl/ .

I also need the list of canonical transcripts.
I tried using the perl API of Ensembl (see /data/Ensembl/Archive/) 
but it's so slow I'ld call it broken.

Since listCanonicalTranscripts_API.pl is impossibly slow I
wrote listCanonicalTranscripts_MYSQL.sh , which directly 
accesses the mysql database.
It runs in seconds (10000 speedup over the API version).
Results are identical except we also get the new LRG* transcripts.
[NOTE: must run on eg nicofree, outgoing tcp/3306 is blocked at TIMC]
/bin/sh < listCanonicalTranscripts_MYSQL.sh | gzip -c >  listCanonicalTranscripts_190918.tsv.gz

Then on fauve:
gunzip -c /data/Ensembl/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.97.chr.gtf.gz | makeCanonicalTranscriptTable.pl listCanonicalTranscripts_190918.tsv.gz 2> makeCanonicalTranscriptTable_190918.err | gzip -c > canonicalTranscripts_190918.tsv.gz

.err is empty, removed.

I need an updated list of canonical transcripts, I wrote
listCanonicalTranscripts_API.pl , running:
[NOTE: must run on eg nicofree, outgoing tcp/3306 is blocked at TIMC]

/bin/time -v perl listCanonicalTranscripts_API.pl > homo_sapiens_canonicalTranscripts_190916.tsv 2> listCanonicalTranscripts_190916.err &

... wow: 16h34min...

After posting to ensembl-dev I got suggestions for improving the
script, see listCanonicalTranscripts_API_withFixes.pl , maybe 4x 
speedup.
But the real solution is listCanonicalTranscripts_MYSQL.sh, see 18/09/2019 entry.

There are a few issues with files obtained from UCSC:
- some gene names are not in sync with Ensembl (eg one uses
HGNC but not the other);
- "canonical" transcripts are not the same, eg for one of our
azoo candidate genes UCSC has a lncRNA as canonical rather than 
the coding transcript selected by ensembl.

Writing getCanonicalTranscriptsData.pl to obtain the data I need
from Ensembl.

NOTE: I cannot connect to the Ensembl databases from TIMC, I have
to call getCanonicalTranscriptsData.pl from home (or somewhere 
where outgoing TCP isn't filtered).
perl getCanonicalTranscriptsData.pl > canonicalTranscripts_ensembl97.tsv 


...
the code is unbelievably slow. Nevermind, I will download the full GFF or GTF
from ensembl ftp and work from that.

Moving getCanonicalTranscriptsData.pl to Old/ .

Needed for SecondaryAnalyses/10_coverage.pl:

I want a bed-like file with CDS and exon coordinates of canonical
transcripts. File should also have gene names: we will look for the
candidate genes from our grexome metadata file candidateGenes.xlsx .

Getting this from the UCSC genome browser (as I did in fauve:/data/BEDs/):

https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables
Human  hg38
Genes  GENCODE v29
Table: knownGene
Filter: [add filter, link table "knownCanonical", in knownCanonical filters add "free-form query: 1"]
Output format: selected fields...
Output file: ttt.tsv
File type returned:  plain text
Get output ->
    Select fields from hg38.knownGene: name, chrom, cdsStart, cdsEnd, exonStarts, exonEnds
    Select fields from hg38.kgXref: geneSymbol

Then clean up file:
# keep only "regular" chromosomes, don't want ALTs etc:
cat ttt.tsv | perl -ne '(/^\S+\tchr[\dXYM]+\t/) && print' | gzip -c > gencode29_hg38_canonical.tsv.gz
rm ttt.tsv

DONE.
