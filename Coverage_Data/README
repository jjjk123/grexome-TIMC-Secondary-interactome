Needed for SecondaryAnalyses/10_coverage.pl:

I want a bed-like file with exon coordinates of the canonical transcripts 
of candidate genes from our grexome metadata file candidateGenes.xlsx 
(currently only has Azoo candidate genes).
Getting this from the UCSC genome browser (as I did in fauve:/data/BEDs/):

https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables
Human  hg38
Genes  GENCODE v29
Table: knownGene
Identifiers (names/accessions): ["paste list" and copy-paste the list of gene names from candidateGenes.xlsx]
Filter: [add filter, link table "knownCanonical", in knownCanonical filters add "free-form query: 1"]
Output format: selected fields...
Output file: ttt.bed
File type returned:  plain text
Get output ->
    Select fields from hg38.knownGene: name, chrom, exonStarts, exonEnds
    Select fields from hg38.kgXref: geneSymbol

Then clean up file:
# remove alt and "fix" chromosomes:
grep -Pv 'chr\w+(alt|fix)' ttt  > ttt2
# remove some genes I didn't ask for (eg RNF141 has ZNF230 as "Gene Synonyms", but
# ZNF230 is a gene by itself, not even on the same chrom; same for HID1)
grep -Pv 'HID1|RNF141|AC026316\.5' ttt2 > gencode29_hg38_CandidateGenes_clean_190829
# remove tmp intermediate files
rm ttt ttt2

DONE.
