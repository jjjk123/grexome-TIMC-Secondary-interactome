Needed for SecondaryAnalyses/10_coverage.pl:

I want a bed-like file with CDS and exon coordinates of canonical
transcripts. File should also have gene names: we will look for the
candidate genes from our grexome metadata file candidateGenes.xlsx .

Getting this from the UCSC genome browser (as I did in fauve:/data/BEDs/):

https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables
Human  hg38
Genes  GENCODE v29
Table: knownGene
Filter: [add filter, link table "knownCanonical", in knownCanonical filters add "free-form query: 1"]
Output format: selected fields...
Output file: ttt.tsv
File type returned:  plain text
Get output ->
    Select fields from hg38.knownGene: name, chrom, cdsStart, cdsEnd, exonStarts, exonEnds
    Select fields from hg38.kgXref: geneSymbol

Then clean up file:
# keep only "regular" chromosomes, don't want ALTs etc:
cat ttt.tsv | perl -ne '(/^\S+\tchr[\dXYM]+\t/) && print' | gzip -c > gencode29_hg38_canonical.tsv.gz
rm ttt.tsv

DONE.
